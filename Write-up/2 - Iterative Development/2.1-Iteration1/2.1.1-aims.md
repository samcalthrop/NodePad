# 2.1.1 - Aims
> *What do I aim to have achieved by creating the first prototype?*

The main initial plans for this iteration in the development process are:

- Plan out the flow of the app/ lifecycle - work out what fits where, how pages should link to each other etc.
- Create an outline of what functionality I need to introduce with external packages, and which packages I'll use to achieve said functionality - this is reserved for if certain tasks become too complex/ time consuming, e.g using [React](https://react.dev) to manage my UI
- Break the app down into individual, manageable components I can work on - use decomposition to focus on smaller components that are easier to program and make sense of in my head
- **Build the basic skeleton of the app** - this means using abstraction to get the basic, most important features of the app up and running, without introducing all the complexities and issues that may come with trying to introduce minor features/ styling, that is not core to the app's functionality
    - This includes the 'Network View' - I would like to have a functional network of the user's markdown files completed by the end of this development cycle, though due to its complexity and my lack of current knowledge on how to build such a system, this may not be completed with this first cycle

Most testing carried out over this development cycle will fall either into the flow/ lifecycle of the app, or the Network View, and anything relating to it (i.e correctly and safely working with the user's files)

By the end of this cycle, I should have a working prototype that my client can use & review - any feedback supplied will inform how I go about working on my future iterations.
