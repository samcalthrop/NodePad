# 2.1.3 - Annotation of Code
> *an overwiew & explanation of the code written to make this project work*

## Configuration

Though this area isn't related to logic/ flow of the program, it's important to set it up right - I'll use `npm`/ `node` to install/ manage files and packages. These packages currently include:

- [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) - provides the wrapper to embed chromium as a desktop app
- [react](https://react.dev/) - provides a framework for UI/ flow of the app
- [mantine](https://mantine.dev/) - a UI library for buttons, menus etc.
- Some core javascript libraries such as the `path` module

Furthermore, I'll be writing with Typescript in place of Javascript, so additional configuration is needed for transpilation. These are responsible for the majority of dotfiles, `.json` and `.yml` files in the [source](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad) directory

## The App

The far majority of the code written is found within the [src](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src) directory. This is split into:

- [main](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/main) - the backend
- [preload](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/preload) - sets up Inter-Process Communication - essentially a bridge between the front and backend
- [renderer](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/renderer) - the frontend

### Main

[Main]() *at the time of writing this* contains 2 files - [index.ts](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/main/index.ts) and [getTreeNodeData.ts](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/main/getTreeNodeData.ts).

`index.ts` is the access point for the backend code. A lot of this file is attributed to set up of the app.

The `createWindow()` function...

...defines how the window should appear, relative to the OS of the user:
```ts
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  width: 900,
  height: 670,
  show: false,
  autoHideMenuBar: true,
  ...(process.platform === 'linux' ? { icon } : {}),
  webPreferences: {
    preload: join(__dirname, '../preload/index.js'),
    sandbox: false,
  },
});
```

...makes the call to display the window to the user:
```ts
mainWindow.on('ready-to-show', () => {
  mainWindow.show();
});
```

...and handles customisation for different versions e.g opening `dev tools` if the user runs the app in `dev` mode using `npm run dev` in the command line:
```ts
mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'right' });
```

Within `app.whenReady().then`, we can set the `createWindow()` function defined above to be called once the app is ready to be shown
