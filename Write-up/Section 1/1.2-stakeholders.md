# 1.2 - Stakeholders
> *Who is going to be invested in the project?*

My target audience has quite a wide range of ages, given that the app can be used by anyone in a work/ school environment. Therefore the broad range in ages would be roughly 16-66 years (teenage-retirement).

However, the main userbase is likely to be a smaller range of ~16-25, mainly due to the fact that younger people are often times more prone to the issue of lack of motivation/ drive without enough stimulus and interest, which the project aims to solve. Furthermore, it's more likely that school/ college/ university-aged people (students) will be taking the most extensive notes. 
*This is not to exclude the older ages from the user demographic*, but rather serves as a more indicator as to who I should tailor my design to, as the range of 16-66 may be too vague, and mean I don't have a clear idea of how the product should run & feel.
