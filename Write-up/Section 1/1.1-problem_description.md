# 1.1 - Problem Description

## The Problem
Note-taking can widely be considered quite a laborious and ultimately uninteresting task, with little to no stimulation or interactivity. For this reason, it is common to dislike the practise of note-taking, and put it off or avoid it all together. This is particularly apparent in students - who will be *the most* likely to take large quantities of notes - though is not limited only to them. 

Many students can testify to procrastinating over revision/ taking notes, mostly for one overwhelming reason: they don't want to. This suggests a lack of engagement and drive to perform the task, which appears to be the root of the problem.

Ultimately, this results in people missing out on knowledge and opportunities, whether it be in terms of revision and learning, all the way to senior roles in the work place lacking a proficient set of notes, plans etc., and can lead to bad grades or even (though not likely) being fired.

## The Solution
For my project, I will be building a note-taking app that harnesses this need for interest and enjoyment. The project aims to boost **productivity and interactivity**, and motivate the user base to actively *want* to take notes and learn:
- The integration of live preview markdown will likely be an upgrade for most people used to plain `.txt` or `.doc`/ `.docx` files, which in comparison to `.md` files could be considered relatively slow and uninspiring
- A 'network' of notes *(a.k.a `nodes`, hence the name 'NodePad', subject to change)* will provide a comprehensive visual representation of the notes made, and how they link to each other. This provides an element of entertainment to the task, with the user being able to drag around, add & remove connections/ nodes etc., and can be seen as a form of motivation for the user; the more notes you make, the bigger and more interesting the network(s) of nodes become (this is inspired by a feature in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), though my plans are to make a more beginner-friendly and customiseable experience, which [some may consider](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/146krq7/total_beginner/) Obsidian not to have)
- [in my initial plan] there will be 2 main environments; the notes network and a space for writing in markdown - these may be opened as tabs and/ or windows the user can freely open/ close - with features such as a tree structure for all files and folders within the user-specified `root` directory somewhere on screen
- There should be an opening window welcoming the user and supplying guidance on getting started to aid in the beginner-friendly appeal
- To maximise customisation, the user should be able to change or make themes (like a colour-scheme/ styling preferences) - these options will be found within a settings menu
