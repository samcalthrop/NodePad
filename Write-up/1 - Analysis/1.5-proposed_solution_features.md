# Proposed Solution Features
> *What features will I introduce to produce a unique and functional solution?*

The features I want to implement can for the most part be divided into the 5 sections below.

**Key:**
- core features -> normal text
- additional proposed features -> *italics*

## Welcome View

| Feature | Justification | Limitation(s)? |
|---|---|---|
| Welcome section | Welcomes the user into the app, and makes them feel more comfortable and informed |
| Tutorial(s) | Provides instant access to any documentation to help the user with any confusion/ lack of understanding | May overload the user with too much information if not implemented right |

## Login view

| Feature | Justification | Limitation(s)? |
|---|---|---|
| Entry fields | Allow the user to enter their username & password |  |
| Submit button | Allows the user to enter the program |  |
| Sign up button | Takes user to a similar looking page where they can create an account if they don't already have one |  |

## Sidebar

| Feature | Justification | Limitation(s)? |
|---|---|---|
| Dock/ Toolbar | One space for the user to control/ change their experience, e.g an 'new note' button or a 'settings' button |  |
| File Tree | A visual display of all the notes the user has. These will all be stored in a root directory specified by the user, and if the user left clicks on any of the files, they will be taken into the Page View for that file |  |

## Settings

| Feature | Justification | Limitation(s)? |
|---|---|---|
| Appearance settings | Allows the user to tailor/ customise the app as much as possible

## Home/ Network view

| Feature | Justification | Limitation(s)? |
|---|---|---|
| *Fuzzy find* | Allows the user to enter words/ phrases into a search box to quickly locate any nodes in the network by title, speeding up workflow | Could take a long time to implement such a complex, context aware search algorithm within the given time frame |

## Page View

| Feature | Justification | Limitation(s)? |
|---|---|---|
| *Quick search* | Allows the user to quickly look up words/ phrases within the document | COuld take a lot of work to implement a fully functioning context aware search, and is not a necessity |
