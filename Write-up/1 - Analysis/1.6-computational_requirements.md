# Computational Requirements
>*What does any potential user need in terms of hardware + software?*

## OS Requirements

### Windows

- Windows 7 & later supported, older operating systems are not.
- x86 and amd64 (x64) binaries are provided for Windows - the ARM version of Windows is not supported for now.

### Mac

- Electron supports macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) onwards.
- Only 64bit binaries are provided for macOS.

### Linux

- The prebuilt ia32(i686) and x64(amd64) binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 12.04, the arm binary is built against ARM v7 with hard-float ABI and NEON for Debian Wheezy.
- Only Ubuntu 12.04 is guaranteed to work as it depends on if the distribution has the libraries Electron uses, but these platforms are also verified to run the prebuilt binaries:

  - Ubuntu 12.04 and later
  - Fedora 21
  - Debian 8
