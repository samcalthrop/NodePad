# Computational Requirements
>*What does any potential user need in terms of hardware + software?*

In order to avoid making all UI components from scratch, it is common practice to use frameworks. I'll likely use a framework such as [React.js](https://react.dev/), given how widely used it is amongst developers, making it reliable, easy to find help for and that it contains a wide range of features with a large community contributing to it.

## Electron

Furthermore, one of the most widely used means to build a cross-platform desktop app from one codebase is to [embed chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework). One of the most popular ways developers do this is through [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). This allows the developer to essentially build the app like they would a website, using javascript as both the front & back end. Electron dominates the market compared to other frameworks - this means that:

- There is loads of support/ guides
- I can inspect many other open source Electron projects to gain a better understanding for it
- Using javascript as both the front + back end means I don't have to spend as much time learning and switching between different programming languages

**However**, there are also drawbacks. Electron produces applications very large in size, due to all the packages, libraries and binaries it bundles with them. This means the user has to have a rwelatively large amount of available disk space, and also the app may feel quite slow/ unresponsive, and not like a native application would.

## Tauri

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is an alternative framework I mentioned in [part 1.3](1.3-computational_methods.md). It uses the same front end structure/ languages, **but the back end is built in rust**. This brings with it its own benefits and drawbacks:

Assuming I use Electron as the framework I use to build the app, the following are the minimum specifications for anyone wanting to use the program:

## OS Requirements

### Windows

- Windows 7 & later supported, older operating systems are not.
- x86 and amd64 (x64) binaries are provided for Windows - the ARM version of Windows is not supported for now.

### Mac

- Electron supports macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) onwards.
- Only 64bit binaries are provided for macOS.

### Linux

- The ia32 and x64 binaries of Electron are built on Ubuntu 12.04, the arm binary is built against ARM v7 with hard-float ABI and NEON for Debian Wheezy.
- Only Ubuntu 12.04 is guaranteed to work as it depends on if the distribution has the libraries Electron uses, but these platforms are also verified to run the prebuilt binaries:

  - Ubuntu 12.04 onwards
  - Fedora 21
  - Debian 8

## Hardware Requirements

Electron has no official requirements, though given that its base is Chromium, the specifications should be similar:

### Windows

- Intel Pentium 4 processor or later
- 512 MB RAM

### Mac

- 64-bit Intel processor
- 512 MB RAM

### Linux

- Intel Pentium 4 processor or later
- 512 MB RAM
