# 1.1 - Problem Description
> *What is the need for this project?*
## The Problem
Note-taking can widely be considered quite a laborious and ultimately uninteresting task, with little to no stimulation or interactivity. For this reason, it is common to dislike the practise of note-taking, and put it off or avoid it all together. This is particularly apparent in students - who will be *the most* likely to take large quantities of notes - though is not limited only to them.

Many students can testify to procrastinating over revision/ taking notes, mostly for one overwhelming reason: they don't want to. This suggests a lack of engagement and drive to perform the task, which appears to be the root of the problem.

Ultimately, this results in people missing out on knowledge and opportunities, whether it be in terms of revision and learning, all the way to senior roles in the work place lacking a proficient set of notes, plans etc., and can lead to bad grades or even (though not likely) being fired.

## The Solution
For my project, I will be building a solar-system themed note-taking app that harnesses this need for interest and enjoyment. The project aims to boost **productivity and interactivity**, and motivate the user base to actively *want* to take notes and learn:
- The integration of live preview markdown will likely be an upgrade for most people used to plain `.txt` or `.doc`/ `.docx` files, which in comparison to `.md` files could be considered relatively slow and uninspiring
- A 'network' of notes *(a.k.a `nodes`, hence the name 'NodePad', subject to change)* will provide an exciting visual representation of the notes made, and how they link to each other, displayed as stars and constellations in the night sky. This provides an element of entertainment to the task, with the user being able to drag around, add & remove connections/ nodes etc., and can be seen as a form of motivation for the user; the more notes you make, the bigger and more interesting the network(s) of nodes become (this is inspired by a feature in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), though my plans are to make a more beginner-friendly and customiseable experience, which [some may consider](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/146krq7/total_beginner/) Obsidian not to have)
- A stand-out feature of the project is to store notes not in folders, but with connections, akin to how songs are stored in playlists - songs can be stored in multiple different playlists as they have criteria thata fit each of these separate playlists, as notes may fit multiple different areas of the users work. Therefore notes will not be limited just to one folder/ group.
- [in my initial plan] there will be 2 main environments; the notes network and a space for writing in markdown - these may be opened as tabs and/ or windows the user can freely open/ close - with features such as a tree structure for all files and folders within the user-specified `root` directory somewhere on screen
- The overall UX is a key component due to the nature of the problem I am trying to solve, and thus I need to spend a lot of time considering the best way to design and implement a system to support this:
  - There should be an opening window welcoming the user and supplying guidance on getting started to aid in the beginner-friendly appeal
  - To maximise customisation, the user should be able to change or make themes (like a colour-scheme/ styling preferences) - these options will be found within a settings menu
  - Environments/ areas of the app should be easy and intuitive to navigate, along with icons and any action the user can perform
  - There will be an 'edit' mode for working with/ manipulating the node network - this should be ***simplistic, intuitive and functional***, which speaks for the rest of the project as a whole

## TL;DR
Overall, the main motivation behind the project is to produce a piece of software that inspires and enables people to take constructive and comprehensive notes, by providing an enjoyable, interactive and engaging experience. It should be welcoming, relatively easy to pick up, and an application that actively aids the user in some capacity.
