Zettlr is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). This means nothing is hidden from the users, and so they know exactly what they are getting.
On their homepage, one of the standout features they mention that "Your Notes are Your Notes". This posts legitimate concerns as to what other apps are doing with your notes, suggesting with phrases such as "No forced cloud synchronization, no hidden costs, and no strings attached", that many apps currently on the market raise issues with regards to privacy.

There are two main advantages to this:
- **Trust** - The customers have complete trust that the product is doing nothing malicious with their personal information
- **Access** - As a developer working on a similar project, I can use the fact Zettlr is *open source* to understand how an app like this is built, and even magpie/ improve on existing features in the [Zettlr codebase](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr)
