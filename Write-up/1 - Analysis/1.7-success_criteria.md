# 1.7 - Success Criteria
> *What needs to be completed in order for my project to be considered a success?*

**Key:**
- 游린 - core features that are **needed**
- 游릲 - moderate importance
- 游릴 - features that should be added, but **aren't needed**
- 游릵 - completely optional features - everything else takes priority and these will be completed if/ when I have time

| Feature | Importance | Details | Limitations |
|---------|------------|---------|-------------|
| Login page | 游릲 | A page where the user can login or sign up to NodePad, granting them access to the app if correct credentials are entered | Requires use of a database to store account details. Also, a 'forgot password?' option would likely mean setting up automated emails for password verification |
| Welcome view | 游릲 | An area to welcome in the user. This should have an option to be turned off for when the user opens the app in the future |  |
| Welcome view - tutorials | 游릴 |  |  |
| Home | 游린 | A centralised area the user will always be redirected to unless in Page view |  |
| Network - View mode | 游린 | A visual representation of the user's notes, giving both an aesthetically pleasing and functional/ intuitive map. Nodes in the network can be dragged around or left clicked to enter page view |  |
| Network - Edit mode | 游릲 | Provides an interactive means to make the connections between nodes and tags. The alternative would be to list the connections, which makes the experience less smooth/ interesting | Could be very time consuming to completely conceptualise and code |
| Network - Isolation | 游릵 | The user can select which tag(s) they want to isolate, and the network will highlight only nodes connected to the specified tag(s). This can extend to be accessed from Page view, where clicking on any of the tags listed within the file will bring them back to the network and isolate that tag |  |
| Settings | 游린 | A space where the user can change their preferences, split up into various settings |  |
| Settings - themes | 游릴 |  |
| Settings - account | 游릲 | Where the user can change details about their account |  |
| Page view | 游린 | An area in which the user can edit the selected markdown file, edit its title and see a list of all the tags the note is connected to/ has |  |
| Page view - Live markdown preview | 游린 | One of the core concepts of the app, the markdown text written by the user should be auto-rendered on the page when they write it | The process of parsing, formatting and rendering the text is new to me, and I don't know how difficult it will be |
| Files backed up on the cloud | 游릵 | A system of automatically saving the user's notes to a remote database, making their notes accessible even if they lose access to their device | Saving all this data to a database may be very complex, and as mentioned in [research](1.4-research.md), some users actually may not want their data being stored on other systems for security & privacy reasons |
