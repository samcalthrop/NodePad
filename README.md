# NodePad

> _A note-taking app made for the user to actively enjoy, whilst being both stimulating & productive_

<img src='./resources/welcomeVideo.gif' />

NodePad is an interactive live-markdown note taking app that incorporates the links between your notes into your workflow. You can use an interactive network of your notes to visualise how they all connect, with the ability to draw connections between each node (_note_), as well as being able to give each note tags.

A short list of features the app has is:

- Unique accounts for each user,
- Live, in-line rendering of markdown text,
- A network of your notes that can collide, bounce off one another and even mock the flocking behaviour of birds,
- Tagging,
- Theming,
- And much more!

## Write-up

The write-up for the project - all the required written work done throughout the development of the project - is in the [writeup](/writeup) folder. **_You only need to care about this part if you are OCR, or any of my teachers._**

Within the write-up are several folders, each corresponding to different parts of the development process:

- [Section 1](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/writeup/1%20-%20Analysis) - Any planning/ research/ ideas formed **before any code is written**.
- [Section 2](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/writeup/2%20-%20Iterative%20Development) - Each iterative stage of the development process, using the AGILE methodology.
- [Section 3](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/writeup/3%20-%20Design) - The design of the app's front and back end.
- [Section 4](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/writeup/4%20-%20Evaluation)
