# NodePad
> A note-taking app made for the user to actively enjoy, whilst being both stimulating & productive

## Write-up

The write-up for the project - all the required written work done throughout the development of the project - is in the [Write-up](/Write-up) folder. ***You only need to care about this part if you are OCR, or any of my teachers.***

Within the write-up are several folders, each corresponding to different parts of the development process:
- [Section\ 1](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/Write-up/1%20-%20Analysis) - Any planning/ research/ ideas formed **before any code is written**
- [Section\ 2](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/Write-up/2%20-%20Iterative%20Development) - where any prototypes for the app will be located, along with relevant analysis/ documentation

## Documentation

All documentation with regards to the finished project can be found within the [Documentation](/Documentation) folder. This is split into:
- [dev](/Documentation/dev) - the guides for developers/ maintainers
- [user](/Documentation/user) - the guides for any user of the software
