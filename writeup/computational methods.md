Problems that have a **polynomial or better** time complexity are known as `tractable`.

## Methods

### Exhaustive Search

All possible solutions are tried. Though possible, number of possible solutions scales drastically with scaling input.

### Theoretical Approach

Using a mathematical approach to solve the problem. Faster than exhaustive, but requires knowledge about relevant theory.

### Performance Modelling

Creating computer models/ simulations based on real systems to understand its behaviour *e.g modelling a car to understand max speed, efficiency, fuel consumption etc.*

### Pipelining

The concurrent decoding of 2+ machine instructions

### Backtracking

Incrementally builds the solution and abandons partial success as soon as this is found not to be valid. A refined brute force methodology.

### Heuristics

Used as a 'rule-of-thumb' (*a.k.a use of knowledge/ experience*) to find an acceptable solution in an acceptable time period. Can be used to make an `intractable` problem `tractable`.

Used in:

* A\* algorithm (satnav)
* virus scanning

## Strategies

### Top-down Approach

The problem is broken into a hierarchy of sub-problems.

### Abstraction

Stripping away unnecessary detail to keep only relevant/ useful information.

### Divide and Conquer

The size of the problem is halved at each iteration.

## Techniques

### Data Mining

Using pattern recognition applied to large amounts of data to find relationships and trends - collecting/ retrieving vast amounts of data to find patterns within it. Useful for large companies in:

* monitoring account activity to detect fraud
* marketing, by using prediction

**Big Data** - a dataset that cannot be perceived, acquired, managed, processed, or served within tolerable time by using traditional IT and software tools -> a dataset that exceeds the scope of a simple database.

**Visualisation** is used alongside data mining to give us a graphical representation of data to make patterns easier to spot.
