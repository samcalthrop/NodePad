# 4.2 - Evaluation

> _Directly comparing my final product to [the success criteria I laid out at the start](../1%20-%20Analysis/1.7-success_criteria.md)_

**Key:**

- üü• - core features that are **needed**
- üüß - moderate importance
- üü© - features that should be added, but **aren't needed**
- üü™ - completely optional features - everything else takes priority and these will be completed if/ when I have time

All my criteria bar the sidebar were completely finished, and it was only a minor feature missing from the sidebar. The only criteria I didn't complete were some of those marked in üü© or üü™ (_very low in terms of importance_). Given that the pretty much all of the mostly completed criteria were incredibly close to being completely finished, and given that I implemented additional features based on stakeholder feedback that were arguably more worthwhile as well, I believe this to be a successful project.

## Usability

Upon asking my stakeholders about usability, they said the following:

James: "I think the app is very usable. I think the only downsides are that there is no way to search through notes, and it takes a while to log in sometimes."

Jay: "I think it's very usable. I really like some of the features in settings, like how easily you can change your account details or what theme you're using. I can definitely see it being a product that could be used by the public given time."

Given how positively my stakeholders responded to the question, and how many of the criteria were met, I believe the app to be quite highly usable, and feasible as an actual product in the market if I had more time to develop it.

### Questionnaire/ Usability Testing

I went further and gave each of my stakeholders, as well as some of the people from my school a questionnaire to answer to test the usability of the app:

<img src='./src/q1.png' />

^ A score of only 8 or higher reflects a very strong app in terms of ease of use (average of of 8.6/10)

<img src='./src/q2.png' />

^ Again only scores of 8 or higher suggest the app is consistent in its use of colours and styling (average of 9/10)

<img src='./src/q3.png' />

^ The majority of people (60%) have a positive opinion about how NodePad compares to other apps on the market, and those who didn't pick agree were neutral, so this is a net positive.

<img src='./src/q4.png' />

^ Again, 60% of responders had a positive experience with the speed of the app, though this time, 20% _strongly_ agreed, making this even more positive than the previous question.

<img src='./src/q5.png' />

^ This question gained 100% positive responses, and again 20% of responders strongly agreed that the app is fast.

<img src='./src/q6.png' />

^ Finally, I again had the majority of responders (60%) tell me that they would overall feel positive if they had to use the app from now on over other existing apps.

Given the responses I've gained, I can say that the app is quite highly usable, given that all the users who've used and tested my app have responded either neutrally or positively to it, with the majority of responses being positive, and some even strongly positive.
