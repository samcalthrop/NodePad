# 4.4 - Final Reflection

> _My final thoughts + feelings on how the project went_

## What went well

- I managed to finish the project almost completely, even though it didn't seem like I would at the end of Iteration 2
- I and my stakeholders like the app, and I personally believe it could be viable to put on the market with enough time and development
- Given I've never worked with web technologies such as TypeScript, HTML, CSS or any sort of databases, or app frameworks such as Electron, I'm proud of what I've managed to achieve alongside school, especially in the time frame

## What could be improved

- I could further streamline the workflow of the app with the introduction of more keyboard shortcuts, search functionality and a better login system
- The structure of the app probably isn't optimal - in the future I would have more experience in app development, so would start off with a stronger foundation and be able to program a coded solution much faster
- The app could run quicker and be much smaller in size if built with a language like Rust using the Tauri framework rather then TypeScript and Electron
- Add automated tests to bring the app closer to an industry-standard application

## My Overall Reflection

I believe this app to be a complete success for me. I've greatly improved my portfolio of skills, learning TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and React from scratch, and faced a lot of challenges trying to get it built in time given the heavy time pressure. Looking at the how many of the Success Criteria I managed to achieve, I'm confident this can objectively be called a success as well.
