## Data Protection Act

Everyone who builds and publicises systems that use/ store users' personal data must be explicit about how data is used - it must be used:

* for specific uses only
* must be handled responsibly (*including its protection*)
* fairly and lawfully
* ...

There is additionally stronger legal protection on more sensitive data, such as a person's race, health, biometrics etc.

You should be able to have complete control over your data, including accessing, removing, revoking, updating etc., as well as having rights in relation to profiling (*like with cookies*), and automated decision making (*like deciding whether to give someone a loan without human involvement*).

Firms must give you a copy of the data they have on you if you submit a request, but can withhold information, *e.g if it harms an police investigation, or national security*.

If data is held/ accessed incorrectly, such as vulnerabilities in a system allowing hackers to gain access, the firm can be taken to court
