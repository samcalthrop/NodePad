# 2.2.4 - Stakeholder Feedback

## Interview(s)

The first interview for this iteration will take place with James. I will broadly be using [the same questions as last iteration](../2.1-Iteration1/2.1.4-stakeholder_feedback.md), with the exception of any iteration-specific questions, as well as the addition of some new questions related to this iteration.

### Transcript of interview with James

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - James

_S: "Do you find the app easy and intuitive to navigate?"_

J: "I find the app a little easier to navigate than last time, though the login and signup pages still aren't as complete as I'd like."

_S: "How does the app compare to last iteration?"_

J: "The app feels much more complete now that the network is in place and I can load my notes into the editor."

_S: "What are your thoughts on the app's design so far?"_

J: "I think it's much closer to the design we discussed at the start of the project, so I think it's more intuitive now than last iteration."

_S: "Do you have any suggestions on improvements to the design?"_

J: "I think it would be cool to be able to click on the nodes in the network to open them in the text editor."

_S: "What core features do you think are missing right now?"_

J: "I want to be able to save my notes, and I want to be able to create my own account to log in with. I also think the aesthetics aren't where they should be yet."

_S: "What are your favourite features of the app right now?"_

J: "I like being able to interact with the network and draw and remove connections."

_S: "Are there any extra features/ comments you want to see implemented/ have?"_

J: "I enjoy using the text editor to write, though not being able to save is an obvious negative. Also, I find that the network is still quite limiting in its current state - the edges of the screen still have a rendering bug and I would enjoy there being some form of collision detection and physics simulation to really make the app feel more exciting and interactive. However, I do like using the app, and can see myself using it once a more finalised version is available."

### Transcript of interview with Jay

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - Jay

_S: "Do you find the app easy and intuitive to navigate?"_

J: "Yes, though I think no significant changes have been made since last iteration to the navigation."

_S: "How does the app compare to last iteration?"_

J: "I think this version is way better and way closer to the final product."

_S: "What are your thoughts on the app's design so far?"_

J: "I like it, though it's still not as minimal as I'd like it to be, as per my suggestion in iteration 1."

_S: "Do you have any suggestions on improvements to the design?"_

J: "I'd prefer it be more minimal, for example using more muted/ similar colours and limiting the app to only displaying necessary information."

_S: "What core features do you think are missing right now?"_

J: "You should be able to save your notes, and I've found I can't create tables in markdown. You should also be able to create or login to an account."

_S: "What are your favourite features of the app right now?"_

J: "I like the network, though it feels quite simple right now."

_S: "Are there any extra features/ comments you want to see implemented/ have?"_

J: "I think it could be cool to use Boid's algorithm to make the nodes move around the page on their own. I do think it could be annoying or distracting though, so if you decide to use it it should be optional." -> _[at this point Jay gave me [the link to the wikipedia page on Boid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) to understand it for myself]_

## Summary

> _What have I learnt from researching similar products and interviewing my client(s)?_

- The app is still far from finished - in a lot of places it is still bare bones, buggy or incomplete:
  - The network needs polishing,
  - The aesthetics aren't as good as they should be yet,
  - The user should be able to save notes, and,
  - The user should be able to create/ log in to accounts
- Customisation is still a key aspect my stakeholders would like to see in the app - more customisation will include features such as users being able to choose a profile picture for their account. This may require a database to implement smoothly, though may be possible just locally for early versions of the app.
- Though I've put a lot of time into bettering the Network, more time is still necessary just to get it finished to an acceptable standard, and even more time if I want to meet the wants of the stakeholder, as well as needs.
- However, from my interviews I've also found some additional features, such as implementing Boid's algorithm may increase enjoyment and interest while using the app, so I'll consider programming these features next iteration if there's time.

I aim to get all of this and more done in the next iteration.
