# 2.2.1 - Aims

> _What do I aim to have achieved by creating the second prototype?_

The plans for Iteration 2, including anything left over from Iteration 1, that I believe I can achieve in this time frame:

- [Solve the error carried over from Iteration 1](../2.1-Iteration1/2.1.3-annotation_of_code####the-result.md):
  - Have the MDXEditor load a given file correctly
  - Get the MDXEditor rendering markdown correctly
- **Now**: Use the sidebar to select a file to open in the markdown editor
- **Build the majority of the network view** - _I originally aimed to complete this during Iteration 1, but due to time constraints and too much time spent debugging, this was not completed as soon as I would have liked:_
  - Have each element in a given array rendered as nodes
  - Render this nodes in random, unoccupied areas of the canvas
  - Use file data in place of the array to render actual files as nodes
  - Drag connections between nodes by holding the mouse button down on a node and dragging the mouse
  - Remove connections between nodes with a mouse click
  - Store the state of the nodes - whether they're connected or not
