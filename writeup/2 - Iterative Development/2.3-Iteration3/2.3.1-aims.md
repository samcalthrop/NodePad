# 2.3.1 - Aims

> _What do I aim to have achieved by creating the second prototype?_

The plans for Iteration 3, including anything left over from Iteration 1 or 2, that I believe I can achieve in this time frame:

- [Solve the errors carried over from Iteration 2](../2.2-Iteration2/2.2.3-annotation_of_code####the-result.md)

**Now, I aim to**:

- Implement a database management system into my code. This will:
  - Handle logging in and signing up, first locally and then on the cloud if I have the time and resources
  - Handle storing user credentials and information in the app. This covers:
    - Username
    - Email
    - Password
    - Profile Picture
  - Handle storing and retrieving the markdown files and their connections
- Improve aesthetics, including theming, formatting, resizing, fonts, and potential animations. These will align with the [UI design set out in Design Part 1](../../3%20-%20Design/3.1%20-%20Design%20Part%20I/3.1.3-interface_designs.md).
- Make significant changes to the UI hierarchy, how each component sits in the app - the current hierarchy will not be able to produce a satisfactory result in alignment with the design
- Implement a settings feature, to include:
  - Appearance
  - Account
  - Files
  - Help
- Add saving to the text editor to save any changes the user makes
- Improve the network, including adding physics if I have time

## Summary of Points

Overall, I don't believe I achieved as much as I would have liked to last iteration, with the focus on the network setting me back due to the steep learning curve and persistence to implement features not integral to the success of the project. As it is, it is not in a state in which I would be happy with the project being sent to production.

As a result, this iteration I would like to veer away from that, implementing **the rest of the core functionality** before focusing on anything non-essential. Therefore, my priorities are:

- Database implementation
- Implementing settings
- Saving changes
- Leaving aesthetics in a state that is satisfactory both to me and the clients/ users
