# 2.3.1 - Aims

> _What do I aim to have achieved by creating the second prototype?_

The plans for Iteration 3, including anything left over from Iteration 1 or 2, that I believe I can achieve in this time frame:

- [Solve the errors carried over from Iteration 2](../2.2-Iteration2/2.2.3-annotation_of_code####the-result.md):
  **Now, I aim to**:
- Implement a database management system into my code. This will:
  - Handle logging in and signing up, first locally and then on the cloud if I have the time and resources
  - Handle storing user credentials and information in the app. This covers:
    - Username
    - Email
    - Password
    - Profile Picture
  - Handle storing and retrieving the markdown files and their connections
- Improve aesthetics, including theming, formatting, resizing, fonts, and potential animations. These will align with the [UI design set out in Design Part 1](../../3%20-%20Design/3.1%20-%20Design%20Part%20I/3.1.3-interface_designs.md).
- Make significant changes to the UI hierarchy, how each component sits in the app - the current hierarchy will not be able to produce a satisfactory result in alignment with the design
- Implement a settings feature, to include:
  - Appearance
  - Account
  - Files
  - Help
