# 2.3.3 - Annotation of Code

> _an overview & explanation of the code written to build this project - **this includes testing**_

## Toolbar

The Toolbar occupies a space at the bottom of the Sidebar, below the Filetree - this will house several buttons, all of which were set out in the [initial plan](../../1%20-%20Analysis/1.5-proposed_solution_features.md#sidebar), and then more specifically planned in the hierarchy chart [first iteration](../2.1-Iteration1/2.1.2-functionality_of_prototype.md):

- [Home button](/2%20-%20Iterative%20Development/2.3-Iteration3/2.3.3-annotation_of_code.md#home-button) - A link that will transport the user back the home view (where the Network is) upon being clicked
- [Settings](/2%20-%20Iterative%20Development/2.3-Iteration3/2.3.3-annotation_of_code.md#implementing-settings) - A button that activates a pop-up window where the user can modify certain aspects of the app/ experience, for example by picking a theme, or changing their username
- New file - A button that creates a new file upon being clicked
- New folder - A button that creates a new directory

### Implementing Settings

My first port of call this iteration was to create an easily accessible settings page, indicated by a cog icon in the Toolbar - this will host many important features of the app, one of which being the user's ability to select the source directory within which their notes will be stored. This is an integral part of the app, and so was high on my priority list

1. The first step was to create button in the sidebar, within the newly created Toolbar `<div/>` that triggers the opening of a [mantine modal UI component](https://mantine.dev/core/modal/) - a component I found after looking into Mantine's documentation that exhibits the 'pop-over' effect that I was looking for.

In order to modularise the code base, I created a separate file for the Settings page...

`../components/SettingsModal/SettingsModal.tsx`:

```tsx
export const SettingsModal = (): JSX.Element => {
  // react state used to globally keep track of if settings is open
  const [opened, { open, close }] = useDisclosure(false);

  return (
    <>
      <!-- the skeleton of the pop-over page -->
      <Modal.Root
        className={classes.modal}
        opened={opened}
        onClose={close}
        centered
        styles={{
          title: {
            fontSize: '24px',
            fontWeight: 'normal',
          },
        }}
      >
        <!-- the behaviour of the background when settings is open -->
        <Modal.Overlay backgroundOpacity={0.2} blur={1.8} />
        <!-- the content to be displayed within the pop-over -->
        <Modal.Content radius="13px" className={classes.content}>
          <!-- the 'sidebar' where the menu of settings will be displayed -->
          <NavBar />
        </Modal.Content>
      </Modal.Root>

      <!-- the button that will appear in the toolbar -->
      <Button variant="default" onClick={open}>
        <IconSettings />
      </Button>
    </>
  );
};
```

... which I then imported into the Sidebar file for use...

`../components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx`:

```tsx
import { SettingsModal } from '../SettingsModal/SettingsModal';
...

<div className={classes.toolbar}>
  <SettingsModal />
</div>
```

... resulting in:

<img src="./src/settings1.png"/>

2. Then I defined the contents of the menu, or 'Navbar' as described in the code, adding the 4 main features I saw to be relevant in my plan:

- Appearance
- Account
- [Files](./2.3.3-annotation_of_code.md#files)
- Help

In order to modularise the code _within the file_, I created 4 separate functions, each returning their respective components as `JSX.Element` objects...

`SettingsModal.tsx`:

```tsx
// modularising each component of the Navbar
const Appearance = (): JSX.Element => {
  ...
}
const Account = (): JSX.Element => {
  ...
}
const Files = (): JSX.Element => {
  ...
}
const Help = (): JSX.Element => {
  ...
}
```

... which could then be used within the `Navbar` component, making use of [Mantine's `Tabs` component](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/) to build the skeleton of the Navbar panel. Seeing how much code is already in the Navbar function's return object, it's clear that the modularisation I applied above was certainly necessary in cleaning up the file and making it more readable and easy to modify in future development...

`SettingsModal.tsx`:

```tsx
const NavBar = (): JSX.Element => {
  const [section, setSection] = useState<string>('appearance');

  return (
    <div className={classes.root}>
      <div className={classes.header}>
        <Title className={classes.title}>settings</Title>
        <Title className={classes.section}>{section}</Title>
        <Modal.CloseButton className={classes.close} size="xl" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <Divider />
      </div>
      <Tabs
        className={classes.tabs}
        color="var(--mantine-color-defaultScheme-2)"
        defaultValue="appearance"
        variant="pills"
        orientation="vertical"
        radius={0}
        onChange={(value) => setSection(value || 'appearance')}
      >
        <Tabs.List className={classes.navbar}>
          <Tabs.Tab className={classes.tab} value="appearance">
            appearance
          </Tabs.Tab>
          <Tabs.Tab className={classes.tab} value="account">
            account
          </Tabs.Tab>
          <Tabs.Tab className={classes.tab} value="files">
            files
          </Tabs.Tab>
          <Tabs.Tab className={classes.tab} value="help">
            help
          </Tabs.Tab>
        </Tabs.List>

        <Tabs.Panel className={classes.panel} value="files" onClick={() => setSection('files')}>
          <ScrollArea.Autosize
            className={classes.scrollableArea}
            type="scroll"
            scrollHideDelay={100}
          >
            <Files />
          </ScrollArea.Autosize>
        </Tabs.Panel>

        <Tabs.Panel
          className={classes.panel}
          value="appearance"
          onClick={() => setSection('appearance')}
        >
          <ScrollArea.Autosize
            className={classes.scrollableArea}
            type="scroll"
            scrollHideDelay={100}
          >
            <Appearance />
          </ScrollArea.Autosize>
        </Tabs.Panel>

        <Tabs.Panel className={classes.panel} value="account" onClick={() => setSection('account')}>
          <ScrollArea.Autosize
            className={classes.scrollableArea}
            type="scroll"
            scrollHideDelay={100}
          >
            <Account />
          </ScrollArea.Autosize>
        </Tabs.Panel>

        <Tabs.Panel className={classes.panel} value="help" onClick={() => setSection('help')}>
          <ScrollArea.Autosize
            className={classes.scrollableArea}
            type="scroll"
            scrollHideDelay={100}
          >
            <Help />
          </ScrollArea.Autosize>
        </Tabs.Panel>
      </Tabs>
    </div>
  );
};
```

... resulting in:

<img src="./src/settings3.png"/>

I additionally gave the components some filler components, just give me an idea as to how each components' contents will (very roughly) look on the page - note that these don't provide any functionality, and are just a skeleton to work off of:

<img src="./src/settings2.png"/>

#### Files

Working on the Files component within settings, I started by creating a reusable set of `<div/>`s to be used for each setting 'component'...

<img src='./src/settingsComponentDiv.png'/>

... where the component is a `<div/>`, with its classname defining its role in the component, such that each setting consists of:

- `.settingComponent` - the root component, to contain the content of the setting
- `.settingsComponentTitle` - the title of the setting
- `.settingsComponentContent` - the description of the content, along with the action to be done (_i.e select the root directory_):

`SettingsModal.tsx`:

```tsx
const Files = (): JSX.Element => {
  ...
  return (
    <div>
      <div className={classes.settingComponent}>
        <Title className={classes.settingsComponentTitle} size="h3">
          header goes here
        </Title>
        <div className={classes.settingsComponentContent}>
          <Text className={classes.text}>
            description goes here
          </Text>
          <Space h="md" />
          <!-- action goes here: -->
        </div>
      </div>
    ...
  );
};
```

... which could then be applied to the 'source folder' setting, as well as any others in the future:

`SettingsModal.tsx`:

```tsx
const Files = (): JSX.Element => {
  // data provider used to keep track of the selected root directory
  const { rootDirPath, setRootDirPath } = useSharedData();
  ...
  return (
    <div>
      <Stack className={classes.stack}>
        <div className={classes.settingComponent}>
          <Title className={classes.settingsComponentTitle} size="h3">
            source folder
          </Title>
          <div className={classes.settingsComponentContent}>
            <Text className={classes.text}>
              the root directory within which your notes will be stored
            </Text>
            <Space h="md" />
            <MantineButton
              className={classes.selectFolderButton}
              variant="subtle"
              leftSection={<IconChevronDown />}
              onClick={handleDirectorySelect}
            >
              {rootDirPath || 'select directory'}
            </MantineButton>
          </div>
        </div>
        <Divider />
        ...
      </Stack>
    </div>
  );
};
```

I then added functionality to the `select directory` button by creating a function to handle the button being clicked...

`SettingsModal.tsx`:

```tsx
const Files = (): JSX.Element => {
  ...
  const handleDirectorySelect = async (): Promise<void> => {
    try {
      // asynchronously communicates with backend, so must wait for a response with `await`
      const directory = await window.ipcAPI.openDirectorySelector();
      if (directory) {
        setRootDirPath(directory);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to select directory:', error);
    }
  };
  ...
}
```

... linking to the `preload` layer...

`src/preload/index.ts`:

```ts
if (process.contextIsolated) {
  try {
    ...
    contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('ipcAPI', {
      ...
      openDirectorySelector: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('open-directory-selector'),
      ...
    }
  }
}
...
```

... and then handling the process on the backend (`main`) by using Electron's built-in `.showOpenDialog()` method to open the file selector...

`main/index.ts`:

```ts
// listens for the request to select a directory, opens the native OS' filesystem UI and returns selected directory path
ipcMain.handle('open-directory-selector', async () => {
  const result = await dialog.showOpenDialog({
    properties: ['openDirectory'],
  });
  return result.filePaths[0];
});
```

... resulting in:

<img src="./src/settingsdirectory.gif"/>

making changes from the original design specification:

varying icon:
<img src="./src/settings5.png"/>

```tsx
<IconRightArrow />
```

and

```tsx
<IconCornerDownLeft />
```

and

```tsx
<IconCheck />
```

varying position:
<img src="./src/settings6.png"/>

```tsx
<Flex gap="sm" justify="center" align="center" direction="row" wrap="wrap">
```

to

<img src="./src/settings7.png"/>

```tsx
<Flex gap="sm" justify="flex-start" align="center" direction="row" wrap="wrap">
```

to

<img src="./src/settings8.png"/>

```tsx
<Flex gap="sm" justify="flex-end" align="center" direction="row" wrap="wrap">
```

- last one works well if I want the profile picture to go to left of credentials - UPDATE DESIGN PART 1

- then I added a profile picture selection to the account section, with a default 'user' image if none picked by the user. the image is selected by clicking on the profile picture circle, and navigating through the user's filesystem:

<img src="./src/settings9.png"/>

- how it looks with a demo image selected

<img src="./src/settings10.png"/>

demo:

<img src="./src/settingsimage.gif"/>

discovered new syntax for styling mantine components, rather than hacking it with dev tools + `!important`:

```tsx
<NativeSelect
  classNames={{
    section: classes.nsSection,
    input: classes.nsInput,
    wrapper: classes.nsWrapper,
  }}
  ...
/>
```

### Manual Dynamic Resizeable Sidebar

#### 'Jumping' Error

When resizing the sidebar from a width not equal to the initialised width, the sidebar jumped back to the initial width before resizing:

<img src="./src/resizeJump.gif" />
The code was:

```ts
const [sidebarWidth, setSidebarWidth] = useState(300);
const [resizing, setResizing] = useState(false);
const minWidth = 250;
const maxWidth = 450;

// function allowing the manual dynamic resizing of the sideba
const startResizing = useCallback((mouseDownEvent: React.MouseEvent) => {
  setResizing(true);
  const startX = mouseDownEvent.clientX;
  const startWidth = sidebarWidth;

  const startResizing = (mouseMoveEvent: MouseEvent): void => {
    const difference = mouseMoveEvent.clientX - startX;
    const newWidth = startWidth + difference;
    if (newWidth > minWidth && newWidth < maxWidth) {
      setSidebarWidth(newWidth);
    }
  };

  const stopResizing = (): void => {
    setResizing(false);
    window.removeEventListener('mousemove', startResizing);
    window.removeEventListener('mouseup', stopResizing);
  };

  window.addEventListener('mousemove', startResizing);
  window.addEventListener('mouseup', stopResizing);
}, []);
```

The solution:

<img src="./src/noResizeJump.gif" />

The code:

```ts
const [sidebarWidth, setSidebarWidth] = useState(300);
const [resizing, setResizing] = useState(false);
const minWidth = 250;
const maxWidth = 450;

// function allowing the manual dynamic resizing of the sideba
const startResizing = useCallback(
  (mouseDownEvent: React.MouseEvent) => {
    setResizing(true);
    const startX = mouseDownEvent.clientX;
    const startWidth = sidebarWidth;

    const startResizing = (mouseMoveEvent: MouseEvent): void => {
      const difference = mouseMoveEvent.clientX - startX;
      const newWidth = startWidth + difference;
      if (newWidth > minWidth && newWidth < maxWidth) {
        setSidebarWidth(newWidth);
      }
    };

    const stopResizing = (): void => {
      setResizing(false);
      window.removeEventListener('mousemove', startResizing);
      window.removeEventListener('mouseup', stopResizing);
    };

    window.addEventListener('mousemove', startResizing);
    window.addEventListener('mouseup', stopResizing);
  },
  [sidebarWidth]
);
```

### Removing/ Making Custom Title Bar

### Login/ Signup Design

### Text Editor

- used debugging techniques such as the dev tools (`fn`+`f12`) to isolate each div to work out where to apply the styling changes I wanted.

[insert image and gif here]

- process repeated for each change

## Network Revisions & Improvements

- note that NodeNetwork function is bulky and should be modularised/ broken down

### Adding View & Edit Modes

use draw function code, talk about several code blocks depending on the mode

redrawing dependant on updating the mode:

```ts
const draw = useCallback(() => {
  ...
}, [nodes, connections, draggingConnection, radius]);
```

to:

```ts
const draw = useCallback(() => {
  ...
}, [nodes, connections, draggingConnection, radius, mode]);
```

### Adding More Functionality to Nodes

- (view mode) right clicking opens node
- (edit mode) left clicking drags node around
- (edit mode) right clicking drags connection

## Implementing an SQLite Database

- take screenshots of ui + code

## Text Editor - Adding Saving

### File Content Saving

mdxEditor docs very sparse, not providing examples of usage, so I had to look into 'throttling' again (I needed this when optimising the network as well, through the use case was too different to be ble to just cross reference).

<img src="./src/mdxEditorNotHelpful.png"/>

After not much success, I made use of chatGPT to ask about how to apply the concept of 'throttling' to this problem:

<img src="./src/aiThrottlingHelp.png"/>

### File Name Saving

used similar concept, only working with a `<div/>` instead of `<MDXEditor/>`, and modifying the save times to be every time the user presses `enter`, rather than every 2000ms. Got backend functionality working with some difficulty, but issue arising when trying to open a renamed file:

<img src='./src/renameTitleOnClickError.png'>

(error occurred when clicking on the `checklist wha.md` file, which I had just renamed). After considering where the error could have arisen, I found it most likely that the culprit was in the sidebar - the filetree only updates when the root directory is changed as seen in the `useCallback()` function:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (rootDirPath) {
    window.ipcAPI.getTreeNodeData(rootDirPath).then((treeNodeData) => {
      setTreeNodeData(treeNodeData);
    });
  }
}, [rootDirPath]);
```

where the argument passed at the end of the function, `[rootDirPath]`, means the function is called if and only if the root directory is changed. This is an issue as it means any files that have their names changed won't necessarily have their names changed in the filetree - the architecture of the communication between front and back end for retrieval of file contents then means that these incorrect names can be send to the backend for content retrieval, resulting in a behaviour such that a file can be renamed once, but subsequent renamings result in error:

<img src="./src/callstack.png">

Therefore, I need to modify the callback such that the correct file names are retrieved upon any of the titles of files/ folders being changed, so the program doesn't take the wrong filename and send it to the backend to return its contents. This means updating the callback to depend on `title` as well as `rootDirPath` _i.e it will be called every time there is a change to either of those variables_:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (rootDirPath) {
    window.ipcAPI.getTreeNodeData(rootDirPath).then((treeNodeData) => {
      setTreeNodeData(treeNodeData);
    });
  }
}, [rootDirPath, title]);
```

However, since the Sidebar relies on `TreeNodeData` and thus `selectedTreeNodeData`, `selectedTreeNodeData` must also be updated with the new title - if not, the title will update, but when clicking on the renamed file in the file tree, its title will still be the original title. As a result, it will request the backend to access a file that no longer exists, as it's under a new name. This lead to me adding the following to the `handleSaveTitle` function:

```tsx
const handleSaveTitle = useCallback(
  ...
    setSelectedTreeNodeData({
      ...selectedTreeNodeData,
      value: result.path,
      label: newTitle,
    });
  [selectedTreeNodeData, setTitle, setSelectedTreeNodeData]
);
```

Upon implementing this change, I found an error was getting raised every time I renamed a file:

<img src=[gif goes here]>

Given that this happened _every time_ a new name was submitted, this had to mean that the issue was within `handleSaveTitle()`. Given that the error suggested the backend was trying to open a file named 'undefined', the data being passed from the front-end - `selectedTreeNodeData` - was also undefined. This suggested that functions were being called out of sync:

1. The file is renamed
2. `setSelectedTreeNodeData()` is called, setting value to `result.path` **before** `renameFile()` is completely executed _(the await keyword tells us it has an asynchronous response time)_
3. `renameFile()` returns result

<img src="./src/asynchronousError.png" />

Where the sequence should be:

1. The file is renamed
2. `renameFile()` returns result
3. `setSelectedTreeNodeData()` is called, setting value to `result.path`

<img src="./src/asynchronousFixed.png" />

To fix this, a new asynchronous `Promise` is called to wait one tick before continuing execution. This allows enough time for the backend to write the changes to the filename and return a result:

```tsx
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
```

The result of these fixes on `handleSaveTitle()` is:

```tsx
const handleSaveTitle = useCallback(
  async (newTitle: string): Promise<void> => {
    if (!selectedTreeNodeData) return;
    try {
      const result = await window.ipcAPI.renameFile(selectedTreeNodeData.value, newTitle);
      // update the title
      setTitle(newTitle);
      // wait one tick to ensure file system operation is complete...
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
      // ...before updating the tree node data to prevent operations occurring out of sync
      setSelectedTreeNodeData({
        ...selectedTreeNodeData,
        value: result.path,
        label: newTitle,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error renaming file:', error);
    }
  },
  [selectedTreeNodeData, setTitle, setSelectedTreeNodeData]
);
```

This led me to think about the way nodes are rendered in the Network as well, as the nodes are rendered in a similar fashion
