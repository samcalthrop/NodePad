# 2.2.4 - Stakeholder Feedback

## Interview(s)

The first interview for this iteration will take place with James. I will broadly be using [the same questions as last iteration](../2.1-Iteration1/2.1.4-stakeholder_feedback.md), with the exception of any iteration-specific questions, as well as the addition of some new questions related to this iteration.

### Transcript of interview with James

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - James

_S: "Do you find the app easy and intuitive to navigate?"_

J: "I found it way better this iteration than the other two. The improvements to the UI make the app feel way nicer, and small things like all buttons and links being purple make it much more intuitive."

_S: "How does the app compare to last iteration?"_

J: "It's so much better. I really like how the app looks and feels, and it feels like I can do way more in the app than before."

_S: "Do you think the app works as you'd like it to now?"_

J: "I do. I think that taking notes is fun and easy, however there are several small things I find making it incomplete, like the fact that I can't create folders, and I can't delete files when I'm in the app."

_S: "Do you have any suggestions on improvements to the design?"_

J: "Not really no."

_S: "What core features do you think are missing right now?"_

J: "I'd still like to be able to search through the app for different notes but other than that no."

_S: "What are your favourite features of the app right now?"_

J: "I like how nice the tags feel and look - they feel really intuitive. I also like the themes."

_S: "What comments do you have on the final product?"_

J: "I think it's cool, but it could still use some minor refinements and additions."

### Transcript of interview with Jay

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - Jay

_S: "Do you find the app easy and intuitive to navigate?"_

J: "I find it pretty similar to last iteration because there weren't many changes to navigation to my knowledge. I do like how the new features like the settings page navigates, and same for the welcome page."

_S: "How does the app compare to last iteration?"_

J: "It's way better and feels like a much more finished product. I really like how the app looks and feels."

_S: "Do you think the app works as you'd like it to now?"_

J: "Almost entirely yes. The only things I'd say are that the text editor has some restrictions on markdown - I can't do codeblocks for example. I also find it annoying that I can't delete files."

_S: "Do you have any suggestions on improvements to the design?"_

J: "Make a way to delete notes, and maybe give the user more options for different fonts."

_S: "What core features do you think are missing right now?"_

J: "Deleting notes."

_S: "What are your favourite features of the app right now?"_

J: "I love the theming and Boid's algorithm - the dropdown menu makes it really fun to play around with. I also like how the markdown I write is rendered in line in the text editor."

_S: "What comments do you have on the final product?"_

J: "I think it's a really fun app - I could see it being an actual product people would use with some time and work."

## Summary

> _What have I learnt from researching similar products and interviewing my client(s)?_

I've found this to be an overall positive outtake - both my stakeholders seemed to think quite positively about the app, suggesting the only things requiring attention were small and relatively unimportant, bar maybe the search feature James suggested to me earlier on. It appears the main objectives of the app have been successive reading through the feedback given to me by Jay and James.
