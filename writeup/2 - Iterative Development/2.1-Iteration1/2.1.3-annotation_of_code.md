# 2.1.3 - Annotation of Code
> *an overwiew & explanation of the code written to make this project work*

## Configuration

Though this area isn't related to logic/ flow of the program, it's important to set it up right - I'll use `npm`/ `node` to install/ manage files and packages. These packages currently include:

- [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) - provides the wrapper to embed chromium as a desktop app
- [react](https://react.dev/) - provides a framework for UI/ flow of the app
- [mantine](https://mantine.dev/) - a UI library for buttons, menus etc.
- Some core javascript libraries such as the `path` module

Furthermore, I'll be writing with Typescript in place of Javascript, so additional configuration is needed for transpilation. These are responsible for the majority of dotfiles, `.json` and `.yml` files in the [root](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad) NodePad directory.

# The App

The far majority of the code written is found within the [src](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src) directory. This is split into:

- [main](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/main) - the backend
- [preload](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/preload) - sets up Inter-Process Communication - essentially a bridge between the front and backend
- [renderer](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/renderer) - the frontend

## App Setup

`src/main`, *at the time of writing this*, contains 2 files - [index.ts](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/main/index.ts) and [getTreeNodeData.ts](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/main/getTreeNodeData.ts).

[index.ts](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/main/index.ts) is the access point for the backend code. A lot of this file is attributed to set up of the app:

The `createWindow()` function...

...defines how the window should appear, relative to the OS of the user:
```ts
const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
  width: 900,
  height: 670,
  show: false,
  autoHideMenuBar: true,
  ...(process.platform === 'linux' ? { icon } : {}),
  webPreferences: {
    preload: join(__dirname, '../preload/index.js'),
    sandbox: false,
  },
});
```

...makes the call to display the window to the user:
```ts
mainWindow.on('ready-to-show', () => {
  mainWindow.show();
});
```

...and handles customisation for different versions e.g opening `dev tools` if the user runs the app in `dev` mode using `npm run dev` in the command line:
```ts
mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools({ mode: 'right' });
```

Within `app.whenReady().then`, we can set the `createWindow()` function defined above to be called once the app is ready to be shown

For further setup, in `src/renderer/src` I have to define all the routes through the app (*e.g. which pages you can navigate to*). This is done in [index.tsx](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/preload/index.ts):

```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<LoginScreen />} />
  <Route path="/login" element={<LoginScreen />} />
  <Route path="/home" element={<HomeScreen />} />
  <Route path="/edit-node-meta" element={<EditNodeMetaScreen />} />
</Routes>
```

## Screens
In order to best modularise my code, I created a `screens` directory within `src/renderer/src` - that way I was able to build a base `screen`, from which I could build on top of for other screens. This sped up the development process, and also made the styling/ layout of the app more consistent and logical.

### Defining a base
The [base screen](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/renderer/src/screens/Screen/Screen.tsx) is currently very simple, mainly just defining rules allowing it to be used by child screens (screens I build using this as a base):

Defining a type `ScreenProps` to give the child screens a type that can be taken by `Screen`, and then defining what the base screen looks like
```tsx
export type ScreenProps = {
  children: ReactNode;
};

export const Screen = ({ children }: ScreenProps): JSX.Element => {
  return <div className={classes.root}>{children}</div>;
};
```

Currently it has minimal styling given my aim for functionality over aesthetics at this point, so the `Screen.module.css` file is very barebones:

```css
.root {
  margin: 10px;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

### Login
> *The [Login Screen](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/renderer/src/screens/LoginScreen) is where the user is taken to enter valid credentials in order to be let into the main app.*

For this screen I focused on making the skeleton for the login screen, rather than the backend processing of the data entered at this point - the form to fill out:

```tsx
<Screen>
  ...
  <form onSubmit={form.onSubmit(() => navigate('/home'))}>
    {/* username field */}
    <TextInput
      withAsterisk
      label="Email"
      placeholder="your@email.com"
      key={form.key('email')}
      {...form.getInputProps('email')}
    />

    {/* password field */}
    <PasswordInput
      withAsterisk
      label="Password"
      description="ensure password length is at least 8 characters long"
      placeholder="password-123"
      key={form.key('password')}
      {...form.getInputProps('password')}
    />

    {/* 'remember me' checkbox */}
    <Checkbox
      mt="sm"
      label="remember me"
      key={form.key('remember')}
      {...form.getInputProps('remember', { type: 'checkbox' })}
    />

    {/* form submission */}
    <Group justify="flex-begin" mt="md">
      <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
    </Group>
  </form>
  ...
</Screen>
```

*Note that since it's wrapped within the `<Screen>` element, it inherits whatever properties are applied to `<Screen>` automatically.*

...and the logic behind validation & navigation:

Within
```tsx
const form = useForm({
  ...
});
```

I declare what properties the form should have:
```tsx
initialValues: {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  remember: false,
},
```

...and then write scripts to define how they should validate input:
```tsx
validate: {
  email: (value) => (/^\S+@\S+$/.test(value) ? null : 'Invalid email'),
  password: (value) => (value.length >= 8 ? null : 'Invalid email'),
},
```

```tsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
...
<form onSubmit={form.onSubmit(() => navigate('/home'))}>
```

and a react hook is used to navigate to the homepage upon successful login, using the `navigate()` function derived from:
```tsx
const navigate = useNavigate();
```
where `useNavigate()` is a hook provided by `react-router-dom`

The result of this code is a login page that looks like this:

<img src="./src/login.png"/>

### Signup

Additionally, if the user doesn't have an account, they can follow the `Sign Up` button to be taken to the [Signup Screen](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/tree/main/src/renderer/src/screens/LoginScreen), making use again of the `navigate()` hook:

```tsx
<Button
  variant="transparent"
  className={classes.button}
  onClick={() => navigate('/signup')}
>
  Sign Up
</Button>
```

The Signup screen is very similar to the login screen, only adding an extra field for re-entering the chosen password, using:

```tsx
validate: {
  ...
  reEnterPassword: (value) => (value ? null : 'Passwords must match'),
},
```
as a temporary validation solution just to allow the user to enter a password - this logic will be redefined at a later date. The rest of the code is too similar to the Login screen for me to have any reason to show it too - the source can be seen [here](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/src/renderer/src/screens/SignUpScreen/SignUpScreen.tsx)

The result looks like this:

<img src="./src/signup.png"/>

### SideBar
> *The SideBar is where the filetree for the user-selected root directory is displayed - for this section I'm only going to focus on the frontend part, and analyse the code for communication/ retrieval of file data further on, in the [IPC Section](https://github.com/samcalthrop/NodePad/blob/main/writeup/2%20-%20Iterative%20Development/2.1-Iteration1/2.1.3-annotation_of_code.md#inter-process-communication-ipc)*



The Sidebar screen on its own, without any content displayed beside it now looks like this:

<img src="./src/sidebar.png" />

### Home
> *The Home Screen is where all markdown files in the user-selected root directory will be displayed visually in a network*

### Text
> *The Text Screen is where the user is taken to edit the text of the selected markdown*
