# 2.1.5 - Stakeholder Feedback

Given that the code I've written so far doesn't give my stakeholders much to work with - this is due to a mix of me not putting enough effort in for some if this iteration coupled with the fact that a lot of the code I have written is groundwork for the app. Therefore this section isn't too lengthy, as my clients can only give so much feedback on what's currently in place.

Again, at this stage, I asked each of my stakeholders Jay and James the same set of questions to analyse for differences/ similarities in their answers:

## Transcript of the Interview with James

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - James

_S: "Do you find the app easy and intuitive to navigate?"_

J: "Yes, it's obvious what I should do as soon as I open the app, and navigation is straight forward"

_S: "Is it obvious how to open a note so as to edit it?"_

J: "It's pretty intuitive, though I can't select a directory to open my notes from, and the notes don't seem to be retrieved when I open them"

_S: "What are your thoughts on the app's design so far?"_

J: "I think the app feels unfinished in terms of design, however it does feel consistent, and the colours are smart"

_S: "Do you have any suggestions on improvements to the design?"_

J: "I would prefer the content of the login and signup be fit into a smaller central space to make it easier on the eyes than spanning the width of the screen. I also don't like the orange of the folder icons"

_S: "What core features do you think are missing right now?"_

J: "I want to see how the network will work, and also I want settings, so that I can customise the app"

_S: "What are your favourite features of the app right now?"_

J: "I like how well and smoothly the sidebar works"

_S: "Are there any extra features/ comments you want to see implemented/ have?"_

J: "A search bar in the sidebar could be useful"

## Transcript of the Interview with Jay

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - Jay

_S: "Do you find the app easy and intuitive to navigate?"_

J: "I do, however I found I can't navigate back to the login page if I click the sign up button"

_S: "Is it obvious how to open a note so as to edit it?"_

J: "Yes, the sidebar is very intuitive and works like a lot of professional file trees in programs like VSCode"

_S: "What are your thoughts on the app's design so far?"_

J: "I'm not a huge fan of the design right now, but I can see it going in a good direction. It's not as minimal as I'd like it to be right now. Also, the design isn't as close to the design you showed me for the UI"

_S: "Do you have any suggestions on improvements to the design?"_

J: "I'd like you to make it more minimal in any way possible, and maybe use some different colours"

_S: "What core features do you think are missing right now?"_

J: "The network is a big feature I'm looking for in the app, and the text editor still needs to work properly"

_S: "What are your favourite features of the app right now?"_

J: "Even though the text isn't retrieved from my files, I like how the markdown editor formats what I write"

_S: "Are there any extra features/ comments you want to see implemented/ have?"_

J: "Not right now"

## Moving Forward

As a result of the testing done and the feedback given, I know I need to:

- Put a lot of time into making the network work
- Fix the issue with loading files in the text editor
- Rework the design to be closer to [the design set out in Design Part 1](../../3%20-%20Design/3.1%20-%20Design%20Part%20I/3.1.3-interface_designs.md)
- Consider adding a search bar to the Sidebar

These are my main objectives - obviously there's more to keep in mind than those points, but those are the main ideas I would like to follow through with next iteration.
