# 2.1.4 - Test Plan
> *Planning out what tests to run, and how to run them in order to obtain a successful and robust app*

## IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

- data front to back
- data back to front
- treenode data back to front (hardcode)
- treenode data back to front (read from filesystem)

## Parsing

```ts
- Record<string, any> to TreeNodeData
```

- markdown parsing

## Validation

- login/ signup data

- mention that using a GUI with loads of selection removes need for much validation *e.g. being able to click a button and graphically select the root directory removes need for checking if a manually entered directory name is valid*
