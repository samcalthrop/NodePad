# 3.2 - Decomposition
> *Breaking down the program into its simplest modular components*

Below is a more detailed, consolidated version of the earlier top-down models I provided in previous sections:

This breaks down the app into much more helpful components, noth allowing me to more easily aim for and achieve certain targets, and give the project a clear standard for whether it has been a success or failure, by comparing what has been achieved with what *should* have been achieved. Therefore, I can measure quantitavely whether or not I've met the criteria/ demands of the stakeholders.

The way I have decomposed the components is such that each main branch represents a different page/ screen - *i.e the 'Login' branch contains all sub-components/ information relating to that screen*. This way, I can track progress not only of the project as a whole, but also for individual parts of the project, and understand what needs to be done to meet stakeholder expectations. This also makes the program more understandable to anyone, not just other programmers, and yields a better understanding as to how the app will work.
