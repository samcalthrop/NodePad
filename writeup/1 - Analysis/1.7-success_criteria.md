# 1.7 - Success Criteria

> _What needs to be completed in order for my project to be considered a success?_

**Key:**

- 游린 - core features that are **needed**
- 游릲 - moderate importance
- 游릴 - features that should be added, but **aren't needed**
- 游릵 - completely optional features - everything else takes priority and these will be completed if/ when I have time

| Login page                               | 游린         | The first page the user is greeted with, where the user can login to NodePad, granting them access to the app if correct credentials are entered                                                                                                                                                     | Requires use of a database to store account details. Also, a 'forgot password?' option would likely mean setting up automated emails for password verification. Additionally, an account is not strictly required to access the functionality of the app. May actually slow down workflow, as the user may want to start taking notes, and not see the need for an account at all |
| Signup page                              | 游린         | A page the user can access by clicking a link in the login page. This allows the user to create a new account if they don't already own one                                                                                                                                                          | Requires use of a database to store account details.

| Welcome view                             | 游릲         | An area to welcome in the user. This should have an option to be turned off for when the user opens the app in the future                                                                                                                                                                            | This may be challenging to incorporate into an existing app architecture, as it should interact with different parts of the app                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Welcome view - Tutorials                 | 游릴         | A space in the welcome view showing the user tutorials on how to start taking notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | This could take up too much space in the welcome view, and may not be needed if tutorials are also in settings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Home                                     | 游린         | A centralised area the user will always be redirected to unless in the text editor view                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Network - View mode                      | 游린         | A visual representation of the user's notes, giving both an aesthetically pleasing and functional/ intuitive map. Nodes in the network can be dragged around or left clicked to enter page view                                                                                                      | It could be quite hard to design an interactive asynchronous animation to display the network                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Network - Edit mode                      | 游릲         | Provides an interactive means to make the connections between nodes and tags. The alternative would be to list the connections, which makes the experience less smooth/ interesting                                                                                                                  | Could be very time consuming to completely conceptualise and code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Network - Isolation                      | 游릵         | The user can select which tag(s) they want to isolate, and the network will highlight only nodes connected to the specified tag(s). This can extend to be accessed from Page view, where clicking on any of the tags listed within the file will bring them back to the network and isolate that tag | Again, this could be very difficult to integrate, and on top of this, and in large networks an inefficient algorithm could take a long time to complete, given that the algorithm will probably be recursive                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Network - Search                         | 游릴         | The user can press a button and search through all notes they have. This can be represented visually by filtering out all nodes not relevant to the search term, leaving only those that the user may want to access in the network                                                                  | This feature could be quite ambitious, and may take a lot of effort and time to get running. As this isn't a key feature, it's one that may get pushed to the bottom of the pile to work on other, more integral features of the app                                                                                                                                              |
