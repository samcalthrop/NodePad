# Proposed Solution Features

> _What features will I introduce to produce a unique and functional solution?_

The features I want to implement can for the most part be divided into the 5 sections below.

**Key:**

- normal text -> core features (essential)
- _italicised text_ -> additional proposed features (non-essential)

## Welcome view

| Feature         | Justification                                                                                             | Limitation(s)?                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Welcome section | Welcomes the user into the app, and makes them feel more comfortable and informed                         | Could be complex and difficult to integrate, as it should ideally interact with different parts of the app (i.e. pointing out where the settings icon is) |
| _Tutorial(s)_   | _Provides instant access to any documentation to help the user with any confusion/ lack of understanding_ | _May overload the user with too much information if not implemented right_                                                                                |

## Login view

| Feature                     | Justification                                                                                        | Limitation(s)? |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Entry fields/ submit button | Allow the user to enter their username & password, and enter the app if credentials are correct      |                |
| Sign up button              | Takes user to a similar looking page where they can create an account if they don't already have one |                |

## Sidebar

| Feature       | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Limitation(s)?                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| File tree     | A visual display of all the notes the user has. These will all be stored in a root directory specified by the user, and if the user left clicks on any of the files, they will be taken into the Page view for that file |                                                                                |
| Dock/ Toolbar | One space for the user to control/ change their experience, e.g an 'new note' button or a 'settings' button                                                                                                              | May appear to be part of the file tree, so should be clearly separated from it |

## Settings

| Feature                                                   | Justification                                                                                                                                                                            | Limitation(s)?                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Appearance settings                                       | Allows the user to tailor/ customise the app as much as possible - the user should be able to have an app personal to them                                                               | I don't know how much customisation I can provide yet                                                                                                   |
| General settings                                          | A space for the user to see and change other elements of the app, such as their account details, the source directory, or even to get help                                               |                                                                                                                                                         |
| _Graphics (feature inspired by the interview 17/07/2024)_ | _A feature allowing for things such as toggle-able graphics, going from minimal to fancy - fancy graphics will incorporate exciting and visually pleasing animations throughout the app_ | _Animations can take a long time to learn and then implement effectively. May go against the principle of keeping it as minimal and simple as possible_ |
| _SFX_                                                     | _Adds an extra layer of immersion, e.g a sound effect plays each time something clicks_                                                                                                  | _Could be distracting/ a redundant feature for most people, so isn't worth a large time investment_                                                     |

| Network of interactive nodes/ tags                          | A visual representation of the user's notes, giving both an aesthetically pleasing and functional/ intuitive map                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | This could easily blow up in terms of complications, and it is hard to define a clear set of rules for the netwirk to follow (i.e if nodes can connect to each other, if nodes can only connect to tags etc.)                                      |
| ↳ View mode                                                 | The mode in which the user can only view the network of nodes. They can drag nodes around with the mouse, and left click on them to enter Page view for that particular node, but they cannot change what the nodes are connected to. Note that they **can** add or remove nodes in this mode . This mode is required as a minimum for the network view                                                                                                                                                | I could easily go overboard in complexity as there are lots of possibilities both in aesthetics and functionality, making it very time consuming. Therefore I should design the bare minimum to make it work, and then expand on it if I have time |
| ↳ Edit mode                                                 | If the user is not in View mode, they are in edit mode (in the context of the Network view). In this mode, they can click and drag to create the connections between nodes and tags manually - this makes for a much more interactive and interesting means of connecting notes, rather than the more traditional approach of using [backlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink). This mode is required as in the normal mode, dragging from a node would move the node to the mouse's location | This could be very complex/ time consuming to program, and may have issues when trying to connect different combinations of entities (e.g connecting node to tag, node to node or tag to tag)                                                      |
| _Fuzzy find (feature inspired by the interview 17/07/2024)_ | _Allows the user to enter words/ phrases into a search box to quickly locate any nodes in the network by title, speeding up workflow. [Fuzzy finds](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/fuzzy-search) work in such a way that even if one or two characters are entered incorrectly, it can still find the desired result_                                                                                                                                                                    | _Could take a long time to implement such a complex, context aware search algorithm within the given time frame_                                                                                                                                   |

## Text Editor view

| Feature                                                                    | Justification                                                                                                                                          | Limitation(s)?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Title area                                                                 | Where the user enters the title of the note - this also becomes the name of the markdown file                                                          | This requires that the app communicate between the filetree (within the sidebar component) and the text editor view, but also the title must be saved and dynamically updated when the user presses enter - I'm not sure how complex this will be to program |
| Tags area                                                                  | Displays what tags the note is connected to. These can be clicked on to take them to a view of all notes connected to that tag                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Text area                                                                  | Where the user writes the notes. This should be able to render [live-preview markdown](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/build-a-markdown-previewer/)      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Quick tools (feature inspired by the interview with James on 17/07/2024)_ | _If the user wants to highlight a section and click a button to make it bold instead of using asterisks, for example, they can do it with these tools_ | _I don't currently know how to implement this, and it may not be well documented/ possible in the time frame_                                                                                                                                                |
| _Local search (feature inspired by the interview with Jay 17/07/2024)_     | _Allows the user to quickly look up words/ phrases within the document_                                                                                | _Could take a lot of work to implement a fully functioning context aware search, and is not a necessity_                                                                                                                                                     |
