### Features/ Services

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/product/) is a prominent notes app already in the market, with 'millions' running it daily. It supplies a vast set of services, making it more of a superset of a note taking app, rather note taking being one of its many features on offer. This can be seen as a positive; one of the quotes it cites on its homepage is:

> "We got rid of nearly a dozen different tools because of what Notion does for us." ~Justin Watts

It can improve workflow and reduce the need for multiple large pieces of software, with support for Engineering, Design, Product launches, Marketing, Operations, HR and more:

However, the community seems to have varying opinions on how good this trait actually is for the app. [As one user on reddit puts it](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/zvojcq/comment/j1t4hir/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), it is a:

> "jack of all trades but master of none"

_a.k.a._ it supplies too much, and may not put enough effort into making its existing features the best they can be. Focusing on just a few core features for my app will make it simple abnd there will be a clear direction for what it does/ what it's meant to do - I can invest all time spent in development on features that will matter to the end user.

_The sidebar above greeting the user could be found to be quite overwhelming, with lots of information and possibilites for the user. This could actually distract, and detract from being completely focused and 'in the zone' when trying to take notes._

Furthermore, the Reddit user states that there is 'no offline support', which is a 'pretty big' issue - notes aren't stored locally, only on the cloud. They mention the necessity of being able to access your notes regardless of internet connection, which my solution will offer. In addition, there may be security worries over what happens to all users' potentially personal/ sensitive notes, given that they are stored somewhere remote - this could be seen as unsafe, or a breach of privacy.

Upon opening the app for the first time, the user is prompted to login and is opened to this home screen. Immediately to me, there is quite a lot of information just in the home screen. As a new user, it isn't automatically obvious what I should do - this is a problem that can only be simplified so much considering how much Notion can do. This is a reason for me to keep the functionality of my project as simple and reduced as possible; only the absolutely necessary features should be presented to the user on start-up. The greeting at the top of the page could make the user feel more relaxed/ comfortable, however it could also be considered to be unnecessary detail, and in fact some people actually don't like this idea of a computer greeting them, as if to simulate huuman interaction. I don't find it to be necessary, and there wouldn't be a very natural place for it in the home screen I plan on making.

Notion provides standardised markdown formatting by default, presenting the preview as the text is written live, as seen in the sample above. The title written at the top of the file automatically becomes the name of the file, shown on the left in the sidebar; this is a feature I would like to replicate, as it elegantly simplifies the process of naming each file.

An issue I initially had with the editor was how narrow the page is when editing, but by using the triple dots `...` icon top right, you can access the toggle-able 'wide view' which makes the page much wider and more natural feeling. This is a feature I would like to mimic, as the wider view makes it feel much more immersive and places the focus solely on what you are writing.

## [NotePlan](https://noteplan.co/)

NotePlan is another text editor/ planner that is available for macOS, iOS and the web. It has a variety of feeatures including its support of markdown.

### Platforms

NotePlan is built natively for Apple products, meaning it fits seemlessly into the Apple ecosystem, and runs much faster compared to **CEFs** _(Chromium Embedded Frameworks)_. However, this entirely removes a large portion of the market using Windows, Linux or Android, with the only support being through the web. This is a large drawback for such an app, and with developments in web apps such as [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), the speed of the app is not much of an issue anymore. For this reason, I see it much more beneficial to build a cross platform web app, rather than writing with a language like Swift, as native apps are now only marginally faster than web apps. For a web app to run this fast however, using Tauri would mean writing the backend in Rust, which is a notoriously difficult language to learn.

As seen above, the app is available both on iOS and ipadOS, identical in design to the desktop version - a perk of being written in Apple's native language, Swift. My focus is on the desktop experience, and making this the best it can be, moving on to mobile versions only if/ when the desktop version is good enough.

## [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)

<img src="./src/Zettlr1.png"/>

Zettlr is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). This means nothing is hidden from the users, and so they know exactly what they are getting.
On their homepage, one of the standout features they mention that "Your Notes are Your Notes". This posts legitimate concerns as to what other apps are doing with your notes, suggesting with phrases such as "No forced cloud synchronization, no hidden costs, and no strings attached", that many apps currently on the market raise issues with regards to privacy.

There are two main advantages to this:

- **Trust** - The customers have complete trust that the product is doing nothing malicious with their personal information
- **Access** - As a developer working on a similar project, I can use the fact Zettlr is _open source_ to understand how an app like this is built, and even magpie/ improve on existing features in the [Zettlr codebase](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr)

### Linking

Zettlr introduces a way to link notes to each other, making use of backlinks. The convention for using backlinks is to write the name if the linked file `[[within two sets of square brackets]]`. As seen in the screenshot above, they provide a more robust means by which to do this: IDs. Each file generates a unique ID that can be referenced so that, if the filename is changed, the link is not lost. This is essentially a non-visual way of structuring the network I plan on making for my project, so I can take inspiration from their implementation. The problem I see with the way they do it is that memorising all these formatting rules just isn't something a lot of people want to do - this is why I think it's so important to make this process much more visual and intuitive.

### Tools

Additionally, Zettlr has a set of quick-access tools at the top of the page. This allows the user to quickly insert images, links and even tables manually, rather than having to memorise how to format these - it's important to remember that not everyone is - or wants to be - a programmer; whilst I intend to make this program helpful for programmers, that should not limit the potential of any other users, and the program should be accessible to all levels. I would like to take inspiration from this, and provide my own suite of shortcuts for users who don't want to have to write `<img src="./i/dont/know/how/to/write/html/help.png"/>` every time they want to add an image.

<img src="./src/Zettlr4.png"/>

Among these tools is a toggle-able "readability mode". This breaks the file down into sentences, colouring each consecutive sentence differently so as to easily highlight where sentences start/ end. This is surprisingly useful, as the monotone colour palette, often times with long paragraphs, can make the text highly unreadable, especially for people with dyslexia. Though a relatively small feature, it shows that the developers have thought through the solution well, and considered all kinds of demographics - I hope to be able to do the same for this project.

## Interview(s)

My first interview will take place with James on 17/07/2024. Some broad topics of discussion I plan on including within my questions are:

- Feelings on note-taking right now
- Current incentives for taking notes
- Aesthetics
- Functionality
- Most important/ must have features
- Current incentives for taking notes

### Transcript of interview (17/07/2024)

**Key:**

- _S_ - Sam (me)
- J - James

_S: "What would you say your current attitude is towards taking notes (do you enjoy it/ want to do it)?"_

J: "I see note taking as a necessity, but I don't find enjoyment."

_S: "Do you have any reason(s) for feeling this way? What incentives do you have to take good notes, if any?"_

J: "The reason that I do not inherently enjoy note taking at the moment is because all of the current applications that I use for note taking are very plain and boring to use, and so there is no incentive to use them."

_S: How important are the app's aesthetics to you?_

J: "Very important. I believe that the user's enjoyment of the app hinges heavily on its aesthetic value."

_S: "Do you have any suggestions as to anything you'd like to see in terms of aesthetics?"_

J: "I believe that the aesthetics of the app should be customiseable so that the end user can tailor it to their own needs."

_S: "Do you think the concept of making note taking more interactive through modes such as the network of nodes would make you or others more inclined to taking notes?"_

J: "Yes, as it would provide a physical representation of the connection of the notes to the user, making it easier for them to understand and keep track of the notes that they're taking."

_S: "How important is it to you that the app be highly customiseable (for example, being able to change/ make custom themes)?"_

J: "I think customiseability is paramount in an application such as this as it is then tailourable to the individual user experience."

_S: "Would you make much use out of a feature allowing you to quickly and easily search for notes, or groups of related notes to more easily find what you're looking for within a potentially large set?_

J: "A function such as this is critical, as otherwise the end user of the application would find it challenging to find a specific set of notes in a large group of them."

_S: "Would you want/ prefer a visualisation of this (this would be done by highlighting all nodes in the network view relevant to your search)?_

J: "Yes, as it would help the end user to visualise where the notes are in relation to others."

_S: "Do you have anything else to add, or any suggestions for features?"_

J: "No."

## Summary

> _What have I learnt from researching similar products and interviewing my client(s)?_

- I need to make sure that, whilst providing a range of features, these should not extend at all beyind what the program is meant to do; I need to prioritise simplicity in the functionality and aesthetics of the solution.
- The current solutions people have to taking constructive notes **may** not be adequate
- Aesthetics are a must - they play a vital role in keeping the user coming back, and really enjoying the product they're using. I need to make sure these are a key to the project being a success, however I shouldn't just forget all about the functionality
  - Leading on from this, these aesthetics should be customiseable, allowing the user to make the experience unique to their workflow
- Removing the abstract nature of notes being stored away in folders, and bringing it to the user visually may help in keeping the user interested, and allowing them to produce constructive and helpful notes
- Being able to efficiently search through notes/ groups of notes is a key to speeding up the user's productivity and ease of use of the app
  - More on visualisation, a visual search would be very beneficial in keeping workflow fluid and stimulating

From this I can gather that visuals are going to play a huge role in my program, and productivity rates should also be kept at a maximum.
